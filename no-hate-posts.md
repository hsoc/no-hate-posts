#   Maybe We Should Talk

Hey you.

A friend or follower of yours must really like you to bring this post to your attention. You see, you probably posted a silly link that promotes ignorance, hate, racism, or discrimination.

We get it, life may be difficult for you and others are to blame. Or maybe it isn’t and you just think that you are better and smarter than the rest of us. I know it’s most likely impossible to change your mind since “you know better”. But do you really believe that because you “read it on the internet” it makes it real or true?  Or did you post it because deep inside you you want it to be true? You see, you may be a victim of confirmation bias. Please [read about this](https://www.google.gr/search?q=confirmation+bias&oq=confirmation+bias), it’s easy to overcome it.

To keep it short, **no need to poison our social feed with hateful and unverified information**. This is just a friendly attempt to awaken you and let you know how we all feel about such posts.  
Thank you for reading.
